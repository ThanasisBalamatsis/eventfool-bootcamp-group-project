# eventfool-bootcamp-group-project
This is the final version of the group project my colleagues and I submitted in the context of PeopleCert's 3-month Coding Bootcamp (C# Stream).
Our app, called Eventfool, is dedicated to the creation and promotion of events. 
It is a platform where people can search for any kind of events in a city, on any day they prefer, or create events and attract participants.

As for the technologies used, **ASP.NET MVC 5** architectural pattern was implemented as well as several design patterns, such as **Unit of Work** and **Repository Pattern**. **Inversion of Control(Dependency Injection)** is implemented by **Autofac container**.
**Google Maps JavaScript API** and **Google Places API** were used for the creation of the interactive events map. Filtering of displayed data is achieved with **AJAX calls**.
**Paypal API** is used for the completion of transactions. Finally, **Bootstrap 5**, integrated into razor pages, was used for the implementation of front-end. 

For security reasons, connection strings and Google API keys are excluded.
